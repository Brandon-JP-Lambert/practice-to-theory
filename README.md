### Sample Output:
```
Underlying Theories:

- Experiential Learning Theory: This workshop incorporates hands-on demonstrations, enabling participants to learn by interacting with the product.
- Group Dynamics Theory: The workshop divides participants into small groups, fostering collaboration and a better exchange of ideas.
- Adult Learning Theory: The workshop is designed for adult learners, emphasizing practical use cases, applications, and collaboration opportunities.
- Innovation Diffusion Theory: The workshop aims to spread knowledge of the new product and promote its adoption through cross-functional teams.
- Constructivist Learning Theory: The workshop encourages participants to construct their own understanding of the product through hands-on exploration and discussion.

Concepts:

- Cross-functional collaboration
- Use case identification
- Competitive advantage
- Product adoption
- Hands-on product exploration

Assumptions:

- Participants have varying levels of knowledge about the new product.
- Cross-functional collaboration will lead to better product adoption and use case development.
- Hands-on demonstrations will help participants understand the product more effectively.
- The workshop will generate actionable ideas and opportunities for collaboration.
- Participants are willing and able to actively engage in the workshop activities.

Strategies to Test or Address Assumptions:

- Assess participants' prior knowledge of the new product with a pre-workshop survey or during the introduction phase.
- Encourage open communication and collaboration by creating a comfortable workshop environment.
- Monitor participants' engagement during hands-on demonstrations, offering assistance as needed.
- Use the cross-functional discussion to generate ideas and identify potential collaboration opportunities, ensuring all functional areas are well-represented.
- Collect feedback from participants after the workshop, assessing their understanding of the product, ideas generated, and willingness to collaborate on future initiatives.

Critical Theory-based Reactions:

- Power dynamics: Consider how power dynamics within the organization might influence the workshop's outcomes or inhibit open communication among participants.
- Inclusivity and diversity: Ensure the workshop promotes inclusive practices and respects the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of participants.
- Technocratic approach: Be aware of the potential for the workshop to prioritize technical solutions over social, cultural, or political considerations.
- Resistance to change: Recognize that some participants may be resistant to adopting the new product, and address any concerns or barriers they may have.
- Reflexivity: Encourage participants to reflect on their own assumptions and biases when considering potential use cases and applications for the new product.
